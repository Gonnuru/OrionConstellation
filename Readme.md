#[Orion Constellations Data Visualization](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1110/1110.3469.pdf)

This project demonstrates using the Matplotlib Python module to visualize data. This project consists of two files:

* [constellation.ipynb](https://github.com/Gonnuru/OrionConstellation/blob/master/constellation.ipynb) - A Jupyter Notebook provided to me by Codecademy which I have modified as per their instructions.
* [constellation.py](https://github.com/Gonnuru/OrionConstellation/blob/master/constellation.py) - The downloaded Python file from the notebook.

I mostly followed the base instructions but I did do a few enhancements:
* 2D Visualization
  * I added color to both the background and the plot points. Initially I randomized the colors but then I opted to show white stars on a night blue background.
  * A figsize was specified to make the graph larger.
  * A title has been added to the graph.
* 3D Visualization
  * As with the previous graph, I changed the colors. This time I used a light gray background to allow the axes to be visible.
  * A figsize was specified, and a title was provided.
